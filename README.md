# VisualAnalytics-Project
The proliferation of movie streaming platforms and online review systems has generated vast
amounts of data on audience preferences, movie ratings, and user feedback. Analyzing such
data is important for understanding audience trends, identifying popular genres, and enhancing
the movie recommendation process. This project focuses on developing an interactive visual
analytics system to enable users to explore and analyze movie ratings data effectively.
The system leverages the MovieLens small dataset, a publicly available dataset containing in-
formation about movies, user ratings, and tags. By combining interactive visualizations with
dimensionality reduction techniques, the system provides an intuitive platform for uncovering
patterns and gaining insights into audience behavior. Users can interact with various coordi-
nated visualizations, apply filters, and explore data from different perspectives to address their
analytical needs.
This report documents the entire design process, starting from data preprocessing to the de-
velopment of a fully functional prototype. The system integrates interactive heatmaps, scatter
plots (including a PCA-transformed scatter plot), and a range of filters to create a comprehen-
sive and valiable analytics tool.
